# Fiscal_Stress_Score
 Local governments and school districts throughout the State and country faced new challenges that threatened their fiscal health after the great recession. Fiscal stress monitoring system has hence been used since then for early actions to prevent these entities from ending up in severe fiscal stress. This project imitates the computation of fiscal stress score developed by Office of New York State Comptroller (OSC) to provide scores earlier than them for each town in New York state for years 2000-2017. The score is calculated based on financial indicators. The scores are used for various trend analysis. It is found that most of the towns came in the category of no fiscal stress while very few lied in the significant fiscal stress. Moreover, it is found that population has some effect on the fiscal stress score of towns when grouped as county.
